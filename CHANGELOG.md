# Changelog

What has changed in Xivi, and when. The design *reasoning* lives in
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and stays there; this file is the
record of what was built.

Released versions are archived one file per release under
[docs/changelog/](docs/changelog/) — see [the index](#releases). This file holds
only what has not shipped yet, so it stays a page rather than a history.

## How the version works

The format is `17.MINOR.PATCH`, and it is **not** semantic versioning.

- **17** is a *generation*, not a semver major. It says which Xivi this is, and
  changes only when there is a new one — a business decision rather than a
  technical one. Breaking changes inside a generation do not touch it.
- **PATCH** is the release counter. It moves every time a release is cut, which
  at this project's current pace is roughly daily — so a year of it reads
  17.0.351, not like semver. Features move it; so do fixes.
- **MINOR** is for a release big enough to be worth naming. It has not moved yet.

Deliberately *not* "patches are fixes, minors are features". That rule was here
first and was false the day 17.0.1 shipped two large features under it. A version
scheme nobody follows is worse than an unusual one everybody does.

**The version moves on release, not on feature.** Work lands under *Unreleased*
and moves nothing; cutting a release is the deliberate act of renaming that
heading and dating it. Nothing else can advance the number, which is what stops
it creeping while the project is moving quickly.

The number lives in [`src/Version.php`](src/Version.php), is shown at the foot of
every page — inside the card on the sign-in page, which has no footer (XIV-79) —
and is not yet tied to git tags.

### Writing an entry

**One bullet per ticket, one to three lines.** Say what changed for somebody
using Xivi, and point at the brief section for why. The long version of the
reasoning belongs in `docs/architecture.md`, which is the rule the top of this
file has always stated — entries that restate it make this file grow at the rate
work happens, which is the rate nobody can read.

Anything a reader has to **act** on — a changed status code, a dropped guarantee,
a manual step on upgrade — is called out as its own bullet even when it is small.
That is what somebody opens a changelog for.

If a decision is worth keeping and is not in the brief yet, **put it in the brief
first**. An entry is not the place a design decision lives.

### Cutting a release

1. Move the whole `Unreleased` block into `docs/changelog/<version>.md`, under a
   `# Xivi <version> — <date>` heading, and take its `[XIV-N]:` link definitions
   with it. Sections drop one level: `###` becomes `##`.
2. Add a line to the [release index](#releases) below.
3. Bump [`src/Version.php`](src/Version.php).
4. Update the version line near the top of [`README.md`](README.md) — the one
   reading ``The version is `17.0.3` ``. It is the first thing anybody reads and
   it drifts silently; 17.0.3 shipped saying 17.0.2.
5. Tag the merge commit `v<version>` and push the tag. That is what publishes:
   `.github/workflows/release.yml` posts the file from step 1 as the GitHub
   release, and fails if the file is missing or the tag disagrees with steps 3
   or 4.

`bin/ci` gates on this file having changed, which keeps working: new work always
lands in `Unreleased` here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A timezone, on your account and on the company profile** ([XIV-83]). Times on
  screen are shown on the clock you are looking at rather than on UTC. Most
  installations need do nothing: where the region already chosen has exactly one
  timezone — Switzerland, Austria, France, the UK — it is derived from that, and
  §8.4.4 argues why an ambiguous country is asked rather than guessed at.

### Changed

- **Record timelines group by your own days** ([XIV-83]). "Today", "this week" and
  "this month" were worked out on UTC midnights, so an entry made just after
  midnight could sit under yesterday on a page you had just made (§5.2).
- **Act on upgrade: run `tenant:migrate`.** [XIV-83] adds a column to `app_user`
  and one to `tenant_profile`. Nothing is backfilled and no stored moment moves —
  everything was already absolute UTC and this is a display setting.
- **Act on upgrade: a country with more than one timezone shows UTC until
  somebody chooses** — Germany, Spain, China, the United States, Canada,
  Australia, Brazil and Russia among them. The company profile names which zone
  is in force beside the empty option, so the page says what it is doing.
